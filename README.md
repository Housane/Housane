## Hello! I'm En Jie! 

I'm a student Majoring in Quantitative Finance, with a Second Major in Economics at the National University of Singapore. 
I am interested in Market Microstructure, Game Theory and Auction Theory. 
During my free time, I point tubes full of glass at metal tubes in the sky. I also write about them too, focusing on Sustainable Aviation developments, together with general aviation news.
